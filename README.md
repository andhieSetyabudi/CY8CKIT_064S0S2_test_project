# PSoC 64 application trial

This is a minimal starter application template for Infineon MCU devices.

## Steps for run and flash the firmware first time

- Enter to the directory "imports\trusted-firmware-m\security\COMPONENT_CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W"
- Doing Provisioning by following [this document](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666&da=t)

	- open the terminal and navigate to the <project_directory>\imports\trusted-firmware-m\security\COMPONENT_CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W
	- doing initialize of the secure-sdk "cysecuretools --target CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W init"
	- generate new keys "cysecuretools --policy ./policy/policy_multi_CM0_CM4_tfm.json --target CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W create-keys"
	- Provisioning the device for the first time " cysecuretools --policy ./policy/policy_multi_CM0_CM4_tfm.json --target CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W prepovision-device"
	- The default device policy templates provided in "CySecureTools" allows you to re-provision a device after running
through the provisioning steps. "cysecuretools --policy ./policy/policy_multi_CM0_CM4_tfm.json --target CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W re-prepovision-device"
